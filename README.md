Dataset from spatial learning experiments in Crenuchus spilurus. Individuals were tested in a visual-cue maze to assess navigation, learning, and cognitive flexibility across trials. Variables include sex, size, trial, sector, time to solve, and accuracy, allowing evaluation of sex-specific navigational strategies.

File Naming

The dataset is provided as a single Excel file containing all experimental observations.
